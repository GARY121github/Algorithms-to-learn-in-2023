# Tower of Hanoi Problem

The Tower of Hanoi is a classic problem involving moving a stack of disks from one rod to another, following certain constraints. The problem has a recursive nature and can be solved using different strategies, from brute force to optimized methods.

## Problem Description

The Tower of Hanoi consists of three rods and a number of disks of different sizes that can slide onto any rod. The objective is to move the entire stack of disks from the starting rod to the destination rod, adhering to these rules:

1. Only one disk can be moved at a time.
2. Each move involves taking the upper disk from one of the stacks and placing it on top of another stack.
3. No disk may be placed on top of a smaller disk.

## Brute Force Approach

The brute force solution involves a recursive algorithm to move the disks one by one from the source rod to the target rod. The basic idea is to move n-1 disks from the source rod to the auxiliary rod, then move the remaining disk from the source rod to the target rod, and finally move the n-1 disks from the auxiliary rod to the target rod.

## Optimized Approach

An optimized approach uses the property of the Tower of Hanoi problem, where each move follows a specific pattern. For n disks, it requires 2^n - 1 moves to solve the problem optimally.
The optimized approach directly follows the pattern of moves required for the Tower of Hanoi problem, significantly reducing the number of recursive calls and moves required to solve the puzzle.
